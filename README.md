# 🍕 2015 Pizza Sales Dashboard

Welcome to my **2015 Pizza Sales Dashboard** project! This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis and visualization solution built to uncover insights from a full year of pizza sales data (January–December 2015). Using **SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **Excel for dashboard design**, this project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable business intelligence.

## 📊 Project Overview

This interactive dashboard was created to answer key stakeholder questions around:

- Sales performance  
- Customer behavior  
- Operational efficiency

The dataset contains detailed order-level data, including revenue, order counts, pizza categories and sizes, and timestamps. Over a focused **two-day build sprint (May 24–25, 2025)**, I developed a multi-sheet **Excel dashboard** with slicers, visualizations, and KPI summaries.
